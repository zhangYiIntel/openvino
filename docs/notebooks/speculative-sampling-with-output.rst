Text Generation via Speculative Sampling, KV Caching, and OpenVINO™
===================================================================

As model sizes grow, Generative AI implementations require significant
inference resources. This not only increases the cost per generation
from a prompt, but also increases the power consumption used to serve
such requests.

Inference optimizations for text generation are essential for reducing
costs and power consumption. When optimizing the inference process, the
amount of time and energy required to generate text can be significantly
reduced. This can lead to cost savings in terms of hardware and
software, as well as reduced power consumption. Additionally, inference
optimizations can help improve the accuracy of text generation as well
as the speed at which it can be generated. This can lead to an improved
user experience and increased efficiency in text-generation tasks. In
summary, inference optimizations for text generation are essential to
reduce costs and power consumption, while also improving the accuracy
and speed of text generation.

Another necessary condition is that the optimizations are compatible
with each other. That is, implementing a certain optimization should not
preclude other optimizations. There are several levels of optimizations
that can provide significant speedup without “bumping into each other”
in a way that will compromise overall efficiency.

For details on this method, please refer to the paper by Chen et al,
http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01318. Additionally, there’s an interesting
proof of correctness of speculative sampling (showing that the original
distribution is preserved) by Leviathan et al,
http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192

      Installation Instructions

This is a self-contained example that relies solely on its own code.

We recommend running the notebook in a virtual environment. You only
need a Jupyter server to start. For details, please refer to
`Installation
Guide <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/README.md#-installation-guide>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------



First, we should install the `Hugging Face
Optimum <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/installation>`__ library
accelerated by OpenVINO integration. The Hugging Face Optimum Intel API
is a high-level API that enables us to convert and quantize models from
the Hugging Face Transformers library to the OpenVINO™ IR format. For
more details, refer to the `Hugging Face Optimum Intel
documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference>`__.

We will also need to install transformers (HuggingFace) and some other
useful modules.

.. code:: ipython3

    %pip install -Uq pip
    %pip uninstall -q -y optimum optimum-intel
    %pip install --pre -Uq "openvino>=2024.2.0" openvino-tokenizers[transformers] --extra-index-url https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/simple/wheels/nightly
    %pip install -q --upgrade transformers "torch>=2.1" "gradio>=4.19" accelerate onnx ipywidgets "peft==0.6.2" --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
    %pip install -q "git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git"

Select inference device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Select the device from dropdown list for running inference using
OpenVINO.

.. code:: ipython3

    import ipywidgets as widgets
    import openvino as ov

    core = ov.Core()

    device = widgets.Dropdown(
        options=core.available_devices + ["AUTO"],
        value="CPU",
        description="Device:",
        disabled=False,
    )

    device

    Dropdown(description='Device:', options=('CPU', 'GPU.0', 'GPU.1', 'AUTO'), value='CPU')



Create autoregressive and speculative forms of sampling with KV Cache support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Text generation is often done in an autoregressive fashion. We will all
support a KV cache (aka Past Value Cache) in the code. Note that we are
using greedy sampling. We do not adjust other text generation parameters
(e.g. temperature) so keep this illustration of speculative sampling as
simple and understandable as possible.

Setup imports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare autoregressive sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



.. code:: ipython3

        seq_len = input_ids.shape[-1]
        position_ids = np.arange(0, seq_len, dtype=np.int64).reshape([-1, seq_len])

        # in all subsequent inferences we feed tokens one by one,
        # but for the first one we feed the whole encoded prompt
        request = model.create_infer_request()
        request.infer((input_ids, attention_mask, position_ids, np.array([0])))
        next_token = np.argmax(request.results["logits"][:, -1]).reshape([1])

        all_tokens = []
        all_tokens.extend(input_ids[0])
        all_tokens.append(next_token[0])

        while seq_len < N:
            input_ids = next_token.reshape([1, 1])
            attention_mask = np.concatenate((attention_mask, np.array([1]).reshape([1, 1])), axis=1)

            seq_len += 1

        return all_tokens

Prepare speculative sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



-  Step 1: With speculative sampling, we first generate K samples from
   the draft model (in an autoregressive manner).
-  Step 2: These are now candidates to examine using the main model
   (step 2) using a batch size of K.
-  Step 3: We go through each K predicted tokens, and if tokens differ,
   we stop and keep the last token predicted by the main model.
-  Step 4: We update KV-cache dropping keys & values for differing
   tokens and repeat Step 1.

Optimum Intel can be used to load optimized models from the `Hugging
Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/hf.co/models>`__ and
