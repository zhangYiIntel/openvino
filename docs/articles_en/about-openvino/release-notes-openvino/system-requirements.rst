System Requirements
===================


.. note::

   Certain hardware, including but not limited to GPU and NPU, requires manual installation of
   specific drivers and/or other software components to work correctly and/or to utilize
   hardware capabilities at their best. This might require updates to the operating
   system, including but not limited to Linux kernel, please refer to their documentation
   for details. These modifications should be handled by user and are not part of OpenVINO
   installation.

   .. tab-item::  Supported Hardware

      * Intel® HD Graphics
      * Intel® UHD Graphics
      * Intel® Iris® Pro Graphics
      * Intel® Iris® Xe Graphics
      * Intel® Iris® Xe Max Graphics
      * Intel® Arc™ GPU Series
      * Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series
      * Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series

   .. tab-item::  Supported Operating Systems

      * Ubuntu 24.04 long-term support (LTS), 64-bit (preview support)
      * Ubuntu 22.04 long-term support (LTS), 64-bit
      * Ubuntu 20.04 long-term support (LTS), 64-bit

      * Windows 11, 64-bit
      * CentOS 7
      * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 64-bit

   .. tab-item:: Additional considerations

      * The use of GPU requires drivers that are not included in the Intel®
        Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit package.
      * Processor graphics are not included in all processors. See
        `Product Specifications <https://ark.intel.com/>`__
        for information about your processor.
      * While this release of OpenVINO supports Ubuntu 20.04, the driver stack
        for Intel discrete graphic cards does not fully support Ubuntu 20.04.
        We recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 and later when executing on discrete graphics.
      * The following minimum (i.e., used for old hardware) OpenCL™ driver's versions
        were used during OpenVINO internal validation: 22.43 for Ubuntu 22.04, 21.48
        for Ubuntu 20.04 and 21.49 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (some hardware may require
        higher versions of drivers).

   .. tab-item:: Additional considerations

      * These Accelerators require :doc:`drivers <../../get-started/configurations/configurations-intel-npu>`
        that are not included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit package.
      * Users can access the NPU plugin through the OpenVINO archives on
        the :doc:`download page <../../get-started/install-openvino>`.
